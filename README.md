# tal-chess

TypeScript engine for chess and other two player zero-sum games.

# Goals

- Code readability
- Ability to play with personality. Inspired by the inimitable [Mikhail Tal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tal). Ideally should be able to play with a choice of personalities based on famous players, through analyzing their games and classifying positions and determining their favorite types.

# Non goals

- Sophisticated UI. Will eventually implement [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) for chess to communicate with UIs.
- Playing strength beyond grandmaster level. There are enough unbeatable engines; this one should be fun to play.
